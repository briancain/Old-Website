				<h1><u>Custom Shell Program: Derpsh</u></h1><br>
				<p>Derpsh is a custom terminal shell that can be used on Unix. It was programmed in C, compiled with gcc. It was made as a joke with a friend while exploring what the C language could do with shell commands. It plays off the joke of 'herp' and 'derp'. It's an internet thing.</p>

				<h1><u>Custom R-Type</u></h1><br>
				<p>Here is a custom R-Type game programmed in Java. It was coded and compiled using Eclipse in about 2 days over the past winter break. It's an ongoing project and is not perfect, but it's fun!</p>

				<h1><u>First Person Shooter Demo</u></h1><br>
				<p>This project was created as a final for CIS 490 at K-State University. It was made with an old version of XNA. I don't know if it works with the new version, so the code is offered as is.</p>
				<p>The goal was to show off a demo of a game engine that was created custom for the final project. I decided to do a first person shooter demo.</p>

                <h1><u>Python Sorting Program</u></h1><br>
                <p>This is a sorting application I programmed to turn in with some interviews. It's a fairly simple application that shows the difference between a few different sorting algorithms. It was programmed so that it would be simple to add more algorithms if needed, hence why each sorting algorithm is placed in its own python script file.</p>
                <p>This application was programmed in Python 2.7.3.</p>
                <p>To run this application, 'cd' to its own folder, and type 'python sortAlg.py' (minus the quotes of course). This will run the application and generate python executable files for every extra python script that has been added.</p>
